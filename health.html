    <h1>Mental health benefits golf gives</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>Reduces anxiety and good for mental health</h2>
    <h3> Why play golf? what benefits does it give? There are a lot of benefits that golf can give. One of the benefits it can give is that it reduces anxiety.
      According to Roger Hawkes, the former chief medical officer of the European Tour and one of the authors of the study, told CNN.
      “Mental health is a big thing in this day and age, and moderate physical activity is associated with a reduction in
      anxiety and a reduction in depression.”</h3>

    <h2>Helps against depression</h2>
    <h3> There are a lot of statistical evidence and claims that shows that sport helps against depression, and so does golf.
      According to Australian study by Kristiann Heesch, which was covered by Scientific American. Found out that women who is
      affected by depression and does on average two and half hours of moderate exercise (including golf) were less affected by
      depression than they were when they study began three years prior. </h3>

    <h2>Happier and longer life</h2>
    <h3>Golf has a lot more to offer than just the enjoyment of playing it.
      It has also been shown to be associated with a reduction in the risk of developing heart disease.
      This is coupled with an increase in life expectancy for those who play the game.
      The Karolinska Institute recently conducted a study that examined 300,000 Swedish golfers in order to determine how this sport affected the lifespan of these
      individuals. As a result of the study, it was found that golf played by adults could reduce their death rate by a staggering 40 percent,
      which equates to a five-year increase in life expectancy for golf players. </h3>
