    <h1>Teambuilding</h1>
    <h2>A health enviroment gives a successful company</h2>
    <h3>In order for a company to achieve success,
      communication and meaningful interaction are critical to building interrelationships between co-workers,
      building trust, promoting personal well-being, and creating an inspiring work environment in
      which employees feel that their happiness is very much valued. Due to the increasing digitization of businesses,
      co-workers are not spending as much time together at the office or outside of it as they once did.
       Golf could therefore play a vital role in having a health enviroment
      in the company, as it can be an excellent team-building activity.
    </h3>

    <h3>Golf is an excellent team-building activity because it has a lot of benefits, for a company to acheive a health enviroment, good
    relationship between the imployer and employees, and the relationship between the co-workers. The benefits from a golf outing could
    e.g. be:</h3>

    <h3 class="punkt">
      ■ Helps new employees develop and strengthen their bonds with older colleagues <br>
      ■ Increases team productivity by giving employees an opportunity to recharge their batteries<br>
      ■ Improves a team’s performance as co-workers get to know each other better and learns their stengths & weeknesses <br>
      ■ Better communication between the co-workers <br>
      ■ Boost team moral <br>
      ■ Respect between imployer and imployees and between the co-workers
    </h3>
