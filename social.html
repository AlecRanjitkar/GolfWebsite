    <h2>Socialble sport that helps you meet new people</h2>
    <h3>The sport of golf is a low-impact sport based on individual performance, but what makes this sport so attractive to people?
      Is there anything in particular that appeals to the majority of people? The thing that is so amazing about golf is
      that it brings so many social benefits to the table. Golf is a fantastic way to meet new people and socialize.
      As well as improving your social skills and enhancing your overall well-being, it can also make for an enjoyable day out for the
      whole family!
    </h3>
    <h3>There might be golfers on the course who are watching you swing.
        If they believe they can assist you in becoming a better golfer, they will come and give you advice on how to improve your game.
        Golfers enjoy chit-chatting, and it is not uncommon for others to compliment you on a well-hit shot.
        If you are consistently doing something incorrectly, they may offer you advice.
    </h3>
